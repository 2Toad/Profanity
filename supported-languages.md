# Profanity Supported Languages

There are many more [languages](https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate/blob/master/argostranslate/languages.csv) that Profanity _can_ support, however each additional language incorporated into the Profanity library increases the overall size of the library. To maintain performance and usability, we've limited translations to the following languages:

| **Language**         | **Locale** |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Arabic               | `ar`       |
| Chinese              | `zh`       |
| English              | `en`       |
| French               | `fr`       |
| German               | `de`       |
| Hindi                | `hi`       |
| Japanese             | `ja`       |
| Korean               | `ko`       |
| Portuguese           | `pt`       |
| Russian              | `ru`       |
| Spanish              | `es`       |

If you'd like to request a language not currently supported by Profanity, please submit your suggestion via our [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/2Toad/Profanity/issues). Keep in mind that Profanity's architecture already supports all languages through its [Customize Wordlist](https://github.com/2Toad/Profanity?tab=readme-ov-file#customize-the-word-list) feature, allowing you to add as many words or translations as you like during runtime.

# Contribute to the Profanity project 🤝

Thank you for wanting to contribute to the Profanity project. With your contributions we can ensure Profanity remains a leading solution for filtering profanity within JavaScript projects.

## Steps for success

1. [Issues](https://github.com/2Toad/Profanity/issues):
   1. Always work off of an Issue. Please do not submit a Pull Request that is not associated with an Issue (create the Issue if necessary).
   2. If you are beginning work on an Issue, please leave a comment on the issue letting us know, and we'll assign the Issue to you. This way somebody else won't start working on the same Issue.
2. [Branches](https://github.com/2Toad/Profanity/branches):
   1. We support two versions of Profanity: `1.x.x` and `main`. The `main` branch has features that require Node 12+, but we maintain the `1.x.x` branch for projects that require older versions of Node.
   2. If the Issue you are working on has a `1.x.x` label on it, you must branch off of the `1.x.x` branch. Otherwise, please branch off of `main`.
3. [Pull Request](https://github.com/2Toad/Profanity/pulls) (PR):
   1. Make sure you run the following scripts in local, and that all of them pass, before submitting a PR:
      1. `npm run lint:fix`
      2. `npm run format`
      3. `npm test`
   2. Make sure your PR is targeting the correct branch (see Step 2.ii)
   3. At the top of your PR description write: "Fixes #_n_". Where _n_ is the number of the Issue your PR is fixing (e.g., `Fixes #33`). This will tell GitHub to associate your PR with the Issue.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- `main` branch: [Node 20+](https://nodejs.org)
- `1.x.x` branch: [Node 10.23.0](https://nodejs.org)

### Source Code

1. Clone the repo
2. Change directories: `cd Profanity`
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`

### Workflow

Start app in watch mode: `npm run local`

> When file changes are detected, the app will automatically rebuild/restart

#### Linting

- Check lint rules: `npm run lint`
- Fix lint errors: `npm run lint:fix`
- Fix formatting errors: `npm run format`

## Appendix

### Dev Tools

The following section includes optional dev tools that enhance the Profanity development experience, but are not necessary.

#### NVM

The Profanity project includes an .nvmrc file, so you can run `nvm use` to switch to the required version of Node.

##### Setup

1. Install nvm: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
2. Install the Node.js version required by this app: `nvm install`
   1. NVM will determine the required Node version using the .nvmrc file
   2. NVM will install the required Node version if it isn't installed
   3. NVM will set your current Node version to the one required

#### Git Hooks

The Profanity project includes Husky for running Git Hooks. Running `git commit` will trigger `lint-staged` which will lint all files currently staged in Git. If linting fails, the commit will be cancelled

### Dependencies

- `chai`: we must use v4.x because v5.x is pure ESM, and we require CommonJS modules

### Translations

We utilize a self-hosted instance of the Open Source [LibreTranslate](https://github.com/LibreTranslate/LibreTranslate) lib to translate the core English list of profane words.

#### Steps to Run Translations

1. Open a terminal.
2. Generate translations: `npm run translate`.

#### Available Languages

By default, the LibreTranslate service is configured to include all available target languages from [argos-translate](https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate). This configuration affects:

- **Startup Time**: Initial service startup. Depending on your system, this can take ~5 minutes.
- **Translation Time**: Translating across all languages increases processing time.
- **Library Size**: The final size of the Profanity library.

To optimize performance, we limit the target languages by configuring the `LT_LOAD_ONLY` environment variable:

##### Configure Target Languages
1. Open the [docker-compose.yml](./src/tools/translate/docker-compose.yml) file.
2. Add a comma-separated list of the [supported language codes](https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate/blob/master/argostranslate/languages.csv) you wish to include. Ensure English (`en`) is included, as it serves as the source language.

**Example Configuration:**
```yaml
environment:
  LT_LOAD_ONLY: "en,es,fr,de"
```

> **Note:** 
> - To add a new language, remove existing language codes from `LT_LOAD_ONLY`
> - To update existing languages after changes to the core English list, include their language codes in `LT_LOAD_ONLY`

### Deployment

Deployments to Prod consist of building and publishing the Profanity lib to NPM, and are automated through our Continuous Deployment workflow.

#### 1. Create New Version
1. Checkout `main`.
2. Increment the version in package.json, using semantic versioning (e.g., `1.1.0`).
3. Perform benchmarking:
   1. Run the script: `npm run benchmark`.
   2. Record the results in [benchmark/results.md](./src/tools/benchmark/results.md), for the new version.
4. Rebuild package-lock, to pick up the new version number: `npm i --package-lock-only`.
5. Create local NPM package: `npm pack`
   - Examine generated tar file to ensure it looks healthy
6. Push changes:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Bump version to 1.1.0"
   git push
   ```

#### 2. Verify Checks
1. Navigate to the [CI](https://github.com/2Toad/Profanity/actions/workflows/ci.yml) workflow.
2. Ensure the build checks for this push succeed.

#### 3. Publish GitHub Release
1. Navigate to [Profanity's releases](https://github.com/2Toad/Profanity/releases).
2. Click "Draft a new release":
   - **Choose a tag**: enter version (e.g., `v1.1.0`) and click "Create new tag"
   - **Target**: `main`
   - **Previous tag**: `auto`
   - **Release title**: (e.g., `1.1.0`)
   - **Description**: click the "Generate release notes"
   - [x] **Set as the latest release**
3. Click "Publish release".

> This will trigger the [CDP](https://github.com/2Toad/Profanity/actions/workflows/cdp.yml) workflow, which will build and deploy the package to NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@2toad/profanity
